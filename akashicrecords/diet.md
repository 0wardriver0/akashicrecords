## Feast Day Eating Guide

- **Calories**: Aim for 1,800–2,500 depending on hunger

- 🥦 Veggies: Spinach, broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower
- 🥑 Fats: Avocado, olive oil, butter, nuts
- 🍚 Carbs: Rice, potatoes, fruit (moderation)

### Sample Feast Day (Approx. 2,200 Cal):
- **Meal 1**: 3 scrambled eggs + spinach + avocado + black coffee  
- **Meal 2**: Grilled chicken breast + roasted sweet potato + green beans  
- **Meal 3**: Ground beef bowl with rice, salsa, shredded cheese  
- **Snack (optional)**: Greek yogurt or handful of almonds

## What to Expect

- Week 1: 3–6 lbs loss (water + fat)
- Weeks 2+: 2–3 lbs/week average
- Less hunger over time
- Better blood sugar and focus

---

## Tips for Success

1. Hydrate constantly – water is your best friend
2. Use black coffee or green tea to curb appetite
3. Add electrolytes (pinch of salt in water) if dizzy
4. Get good sleep, especially on fasting days
5. Move your body – walking is great, light strength training helps

---

## Warnings

- Headaches or fatigue early on (usually resolve after week 1)
- Don’t binge on feast days
- Watch for dizzy spells – stay hydrated
- Prioritize 100–150g protein on feast days to protect muscle
- Check with a doctor if on medications or if health issues arise

---

## Optional: Track Your Progress

- Weigh in 1x/week (e.g., Sunday morning, post-fast)
- Take body measurements monthly (waist, chest, hips)
- Consider progress photos monthly

---

## Final Notes

- You’re giving your body a powerful break to burn fat and reset metabolism
- Stay consistent – first 2 weeks are hardest
- This plan can absolutely work for someone at 340 lbs
- Reevaluate every 4–6 weeks based on energy, weight loss, and mood

# 📉 Weekly Caloric Deficit on Strict Alternate-Day Fasting (0-Calorie Fasts)

## ⚖️ Starting Weight: 340 lbs

---

## 🔥 Step 1: Estimate Maintenance Calories (TDEE)

Estimated daily calorie burn (**TDEE**) based on body weight and light activity:

- **Sedentary**: ~3,000–3,200 calories/day  
- **Lightly Active**: ~3,500–3,800 calories/day

We'll use:
> **Estimated TDEE: 3,500 calories/day**

---

## 📅 Step 2: Weekly Calorie Breakdown on ADF

### ADF Pattern:
- **3 Fasting Days (0 calories)**  
- **4 Feast Days (normal eating)**

---

## Scenario 1: Feast Days at Maintenance (3,500 cal/day)

| Day        | Calories Consumed |
|------------|--------------------|
| Mon (Feast) | 3,500              |
| Tue (Fast)  | 0                  |
| Wed (Feast) | 3,500              |
| Thu (Fast)  | 0                  |
| Fri (Feast) | 3,500              |
| Sat (Fast)  | 0                  |
| Sun (Feast) | 3,500              |

**Weekly Total Intake**:  
4 × 3,500 = **14,000 calories**

**Weekly Maintenance Need**:  
7 × 3,500 = **24,500 calories**

**Weekly Deficit**:  
24,500 − 14,000 = **10,500 calories/week**

**Fat Loss Equivalent**:  
10,500 ÷ 3,500 = **~3 lbs/week**

---

## Scenario 2: Feast Days at Slight Deficit (2,500 cal/day)

| Day        | Calories Consumed |
|------------|--------------------|
| Mon (Feast) | 2,500              |
| Tue (Fast)  | 0                  |
| Wed (Feast) | 2,500              |
| Thu (Fast)  | 0                  |
| Fri (Feast) | 2,500              |
| Sat (Fast)  | 0                  |
| Sun (Feast) | 2,500              |

**Weekly Total Intake**:  
4 × 2,500 = **10,000 calories**

**Weekly Deficit**:  
24,500 − 10,000 = **14,500 calories/week**

**Fat Loss Equivalent**:  
14,500 ÷ 3,500 = **~4+ lbs/week**

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **Strict ADF with 0-calorie fasts creates a massive deficit**
- **Expected Weekly Fat Loss**:
  - ~**3 lbs/week** (if eating at maintenance)
  - ~**4+ lbs/week** (if eating slightly below maintenance)

---

## ✅ Tips to Maximize Results

- Keep feast days clean: protein, veggies, healthy fats
- Avoid binging or overeating “because you fasted”
- Stay hydrated and get enough electrolytes
- Track weekly weight (same time, same scale)

---

## 🧮 Optional: Weight Projection (6 Months)

- **Conservative (3 lbs/week)** × 26 weeks = **~78 lbs**
- **Aggressive (4 lbs/week)** × 26 weeks = **~104 lbs**

**Estimated weight after 6 months**:  
> **Between 262 – 270 lbs** (realistic and achievable)
